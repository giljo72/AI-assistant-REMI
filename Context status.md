# Context Controls Implementation Status

## What's ACTUALLY Implemented vs. Your Vision

### Your Vision (As Described in Vision Alignment.md)
You described a specific context control interface under the chat bar with these indicators:
- Context: Standard
- System Prompt: Enabled
- Business Analysis: Active
- Project Prompt: Enabled
- Global Data: Disabled
- Project Documents: Enabled

Key behavior: When starting a new chat within a project, it's extremely aware of other chats and documents in that project by default, with expansion to global context only when explicitly enabled.

### What's Actually Built (Based on Devlog.md)

#### January 22, 2025 Implementation:
1. **Context Controls Modal**
   - "Fixed context controls integration - clicking context indicator now opens modal"
   - "Added yellow Context indicator to status bar"
   - "Moved Self-Aware mode to Context Controls (Mode dropdown)"
   - Created context creation with presets and custom options

2. **Mode Selection System**
   - A "Mode" dropdown with predefined modes:
     - Self-Aware mode (can read codebase)
     - Standard mode
     - Business Analysis mode (mentioned in your vision)
   - NOT individual toggles for each aspect

3. **Visual Implementation**
   - Yellow context indicator in status bar (clickable)
   - Opens modal for detailed control
   - Shows current mode only, not granular settings

### The Gap Analysis

#### What You Have:
- ✅ Context awareness system implemented
- ✅ Modal-based context controls
- ✅ Visual indicator showing active context
- ✅ Mode-based selection (simplified)
- ✅ Project containment by default
- ✅ Document integration in Self-Aware mode

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Six individual toggle indicators you described
- ❌ Granular control over each context aspect
- ❌ Separate toggles for System Prompt, Project Prompt, Global Data, etc.
- ❌ Real-time status display of all context sources

### Current Implementation Details

#### Frontend Components (Actually Built):
1. **ContextControlsPanel** - Modal for context selection
2. **ContextStatusIndicators** - Shows active prompts inline
3. **Mode selector** in modal (not individual toggles)
4. **Personal Profiles** system (added Jan 24)
5. **System Prompts** management (added Jan 25)

#### Backend Status:
- Context controls backend: ❌ Not Implemented (per implementation.md)
- The UI exists but backend doesn't process granular context settings
- Models receive context through prompts, not through context control settings

### The Simplified Reality

Instead of your 6-toggle vision, the implementation is:
1. **Mode Selection** - Choose an operational mode
2. **System Prompts** - Active system prompt indicator (orange)
3. **User Prompts** - Active user prompts indicator (gray)
4. **Personal Profile** - Automatically appended context

### How Context Actually Works Now

1. **Project Containment**: Files are linked to projects in the database
2. **Mode Selection**: Affects how the AI behaves (e.g., Self-Aware can read files)
3. **Prompt Stacking**: System + User + Personal prompts combined
4. **Document Context**: Only in Self-Aware mode, not toggleable

### Recommendation for Documentation Updates

1. **Scope.md** should clarify:
   - Current: Mode-based context selection
   - Future: Granular toggle-based controls
   - Decision point: Is simplified mode selection sufficient?

2. **Implementation.md** should update:
   - Context Controls UI: ✅ Complete (mode-based)
   - Context controls backend: ❌ Not Implemented
   - Note the simplified approach taken

3. **Clarify Intent**:
   - Was the 6-toggle interface the ultimate goal?
   - Or is the current mode-based approach acceptable?
   - Should future development add granular controls?

### Summary

You have a working context control system, but it's significantly simplified from your original vision. Instead of granular toggles for each context source, you have mode-based selection with automatic context inclusion based on the selected mode. The infrastructure exists to expand to your full vision, but currently operates in a more streamlined fashion.
