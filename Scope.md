# Scout: Project Vision & Scope

## Vision Statement

Scout creates a fully private, locally-hosted knowledge management system that gives users complete control over their data while providing enterprise-grade AI capabilities. We believe powerful AI assistance should not require surrendering data ownership or privacy.

**Why Scout?** The name reflects our core mission - to help users explore, discover, and navigate through their knowledge landscape. Like a trusted scout, this AI assistant guides you through complex information terrain while keeping your data secure and private.

## Core Philosophy

**Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on user hardware. No cloud dependencies, no data leaves the system.

**Project-Centered**: Knowledge organization mirrors real-world workflows through self-contained project environments.

**Transparent Intelligence**: Users see exactly what context influences AI responses through visual indicators and relevance scores.

**Hardware Optimized**: Fully utilizes modern GPU capabilities for professional-grade performance.

## Target Users & Value Propositions

### Privacy-Focused Professionals

- **Value**: Intuitive project-based knowledge management
- **Benefit**: Faster insights from organized information

### Technical Teams
- **Need**: Customizable AI tooling for development
- **Value**: Local model flexibility with production reliability
- **Benefit**: Adapt AI behavior to specific workflows

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Model AI Intelligence
Unified interface to multiple specialized AI models, each optimized for specific tasks - from quick responses to deep reasoning, code generation to document analysis.

### 2. Project-Centered Knowledge Management
Projects act as self-contained knowledge environments, maintaining context boundaries while allowing controlled expansion when needed.

### 3. Semantic Document Understanding
Advanced document processing that understands content meaning, not just text, enabling intelligent retrieval and contextual responses.

### 4. Universal Search
Comprehensive search across all knowledge domains - conversations, documents, and processed knowledge - with transparent relevance scoring.

### 5. Visual Context Awareness
Clear indicators showing what information influences AI responses, document relevance scores, and active context scope.

### 6. Real-Time System Monitoring
Live hardware utilization, model status, and service health tracking for optimal performance management.

### 7. Self-Aware Development Mode
AI assistant can read and analyze its own source code, suggest improvements, and assist with debugging - enabling continuous self-improvement while maintaining security through validation and audit trails. The assistant has direct read access to all project files, displaying actual code content with syntax highlighting and proper formatting. 

In password-protected self-aware mode, the assistant gains write capabilities:
- **Write Access**: Can modify files on F:\ drive with user approval
- **Command Execution**: Can run system commands with user approval
- **Security First**: Every action requires individual approval - no batch operations
- **Audit Trail**: All modifications backed up and logged
- **Visual Indicators**: Bright red badge shows when write mode is active

### 8. Personal Context Memory
The assistant maintains structured profiles about people you interact with, providing contextually aware assistance based on relationships, roles, and personal notes. This human-centric knowledge base enhances the AI's ability to provide personalized communication suggestions and relationship insights.

Key features:
- **Rich Profiles**: Track names, roles, organizations, birthdays, communication preferences
- **Flexible Notes**: Markdown-supported notes for capturing any additional context
- **Visibility Control**: Private (just you), Shared (team), or Global (everyone) settings
- **Automatic Context**: Profiles automatically enhance chat conversations
- **Relationship Types**: Colleagues, family, friends, clients with appropriate context

### 9. User Authentication & Access Control
A secure, role-based authentication system that maintains privacy while enabling controlled collaboration.

Key features:
- **First-Time Setup**: Wizard creates initial admin account with recovery PIN
- **Two-Tier Access**: Admin (full features) and User (focused experience) roles
- **Session Management**: 48-hour sessions with remember-me functionality
- **Project Sharing**: Users can invite others to collaborate on projects
- **Visibility Control**: Private items become global when projects are shared
- **Development Mode**: Environment-based bypasses for development flexibility
