# Session Memory Instructions

## File Naming Convention
When creating session memory files, use the following format:
- `memory_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS].md`
- Example: `memory_20250529_013128.md`

## Purpose
Save your work sessions here with timestamped filenames to preserve context across sessions.

## Current Session
- Active session memory should be tracked in `current-session.md`
- When session ends, rename it to timestamped format above
