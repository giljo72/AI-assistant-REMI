### Claude Code Memory Management Session
- **Goal**: Learn how to preserve context across WSL/system reboots
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Claude Code has built-in memory features (./CLAUDE.md and ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
  - Use `#` shortcut for quick memory additions during sessions
  - Use `/memory` command to edit memory files directly
  - Memory imports possible with `@path/to/file` syntax (max 5 hops)
  - Memories persist automatically across reboots
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created sessions/ directory for tracking work
  - Added SESSION MEMORY section to main CLAUDE.md
  - Established naming convention: memory_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
- **Next Time**: Can request "add today's session to sessions/memory.md" for quick logging
