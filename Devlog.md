- Enhanced debugging with detailed logs for state transitions
- Modified event propagation handling to prevent unwanted navigation
- Created new types/common.ts file with type definitions and helper functions:
  ```typescript
  export type ProjectId = string | null;

  export function normalizeProjectId(value: unknown): ProjectId {
    if (value === null || value === undefined || value === '') {
      return null;
    }
    
    if (typeof value === 'string') {
      return value;
    }
    
    // For object type nulls (caused by JSON parsing)
    if (value && typeof value === 'object') {
      return null;
    }
    
    return null;
  }

  export function isFileLinkedToProject(fileProjectId: unknown): boolean {
    const normalizedId = normalizeProjectId(fileProjectId);
    return normalizedId !== null;
  }
  ```
- Implemented file service helpers to ensure consistent project ID handling:

- Type comparisons failing with strict equality (`===`) between different representations of null
- Mock implementation not properly syncing between components
- localStorage persistence not maintaining proper type information
