## Key initiative for this Entry
Refining our understanding and implementation of the Project-Centered Containment approach

# Action items and activities
- Reviewed existing implementation of the UI components (MainLayout, ProjectSidebar, ChatView, DocumentView)
- Identified misalignment between current implementation and intended project-centered containment model
- Updated core documentation (Scope.md, implementation.md, and Readme.MD) to clearly define containment approach
- Analyzed the assistant-projectv2.pdf design document to better understand the intended UI workflow
- Updated project architecture to formalize "containment by default, expansion by choice" principle
- Consolidated our understanding of project-specific chats and document attachments

# Technical Decisions
- Refined the project-centered containment model without changing the core tech stack
- Determined that PostgreSQL with pgvector remains appropriate for implementing project-centered retrieval
- Decided to maintain the UI-first implementation approach with progressive enhancement
- Created a dedicated implementation phase for project-centered components
- Established a clearer data model for project-chat and project-document relationships
- Defined a more explicit visual approach for indicating project context in the UI

# Challenges Encountered
- Current UI implementation was displaying all chats regardless of project context
- Project sidebar wasn't showing clear containment relationships
- Needed to better articulate the relationship between projects, chats, and documents
- Required clearer definitions for when and how users can expand beyond project boundaries
- Working out the balance between containment for better performance and expansion for broader knowledge

# Architecture Refinements
- **Project-First Containment**: Projects are self-contained knowledge environments with their own chats and attached documents
- **Selective Expansion**: Users can explicitly opt to expand beyond containment boundaries via context controls
- **Performance Benefits**: Containment limits context scope by default for better performance
- **Visual Indicators**: UI will clearly show project context and when expanded context is being used
- **Future Extensions**: The same containment/expansion model will apply to external integrations

# Next Steps
- Update the ProjectManagerView component to properly show only chats from the active project
- Implement a project-specific file attachment system
- Create modals for attaching files to projects, deleting projects, and modifying projects
- Build a proper context controls component with project containment awareness
- Implement visual indicators for project context throughout the UI
- Continue with the UI-first implementation approach, ensuring all components respect project boundaries

# Implementation Updates
- Modified implementation plan to include a dedicated phase for project-centered components
- Added progress tracking for completed components
- Created a more detailed list of next components to implement
- Updated data model documentation to better reflect containment relationships
- Reviewed the assistant-projectv2.pdf UI design document to ensure alignment with containment approach

The project-centered containment approach provides significant benefits for organization, performance, and user experience. By preserving this core architectural principle throughout our implementation, we'll deliver an intuitive, powerful system that aligns with natural human workflows while providing the flexibility to expand context when needed.

## Key Initiative: User Prompts Implementation

We've successfully implemented the User Prompts functionality according to the workflow designs in the assistant-projectv2.pdf document. This feature allows users to create, manage, and activate custom prompts that are applied to conversations with the AI assistant.

### Components Implemented:

1. **UserPromptModal.tsx** (frontend/src/components/modals/)
   - Modal dialog for creating and editing user prompts
   - Includes fields for prompt name and content
   - Support for both creation and modification modes
   - Delete functionality for existing prompts
   - Styled with navy/gold theme to match design specifications

2. **UserPromptManager.tsx** (frontend/src/components/chat/)
   - Manages a list of user prompts
   - Provides UI for adding, editing, and deleting prompts
   - Checkbox functionality to activate/deactivate prompts
   - Ensures only one prompt can be active at a time

3. **UserPromptIndicator.tsx** (frontend/src/components/chat/)
   - Visual indicator component for the chat interface
   - Shows when a user prompt is active
   - Displays prompt name with tooltip for full content
   - Quick deactivation button

4. **UserPromptsPanel.tsx** (frontend/src/components/chat/)
   - Container component that integrates user prompts into the chat interface
   - Collapsible/expandable panel functionality
   - Shows indicator when a prompt is active
   - Controls the visibility of the prompt manager

### Redux State Management:

1. **userPromptsSlice.ts** (frontend/src/store/)
   - Redux slice for managing user prompts state
   - Actions for adding, updating, deleting prompts
   - Actions for activating/deactivating prompts
   - Maintains active prompt ID in the state

2. **projectSettingsSlice.ts** (frontend/src/store/)
   - Redux slice for project-level settings
   - Toggle functionality for project prompt, global data, and project documents
   - Used by the context status indicators

### Integration and Updates:

1. **ChatView.tsx** (frontend/src/components/chat/)
   - Updated to include UserPromptsPanel component
   - Added Redux store connections for prompt and settings state
   - Integrated with ContextStatusIndicators
   - Properly typed for TypeScript compliance

2. **App.tsx** (frontend/src/)
   - Added Redux Provider wrapper to make store available to all components
   - Identified issue with incomplete props being passed to ChatView (to be addressed)

### Technical Challenges and Solutions:

1. **TypeScript Typing Issues**
   - Fixed 'any' type warnings in array.find() methods
   - Added proper event typing for onChange handlers
   - Resolved props interface mismatches between components

2. **Redux Integration**
   - Implemented proper Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch)
   - Created action creators for updating state
   - Set up store configuration with middleware

3. **Naming Convention Conflicts**
   - Identified prop naming mismatches (e.g., `isProjectPromptEnabled` vs `projectPromptEnabled`)
   - Adapted calls to match existing component interfaces rather than modifying components
   - This approach prevented potential cascading issues throughout the codebase

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Installed required packages: uuid, @types/uuid
   - Added Material UI components (@mui/material, @mui/icons-material)

### Outstanding Issues:

1. **ChatView Props in App.tsx**
   - The ChatView component in App.tsx is missing required props
   - Need to implement logic for fetching project/chat names and messages

2. **Linting Warnings**
   - Several unused variables flagged (activePrompt, contextControlsOpen)
   - These will be addressed as functionality is implemented that uses them

3. **React Import Warning**
   - React is imported but not directly used (common in modern JSX transform)
   - Can be safely ignored or fixed with eslint disable comment

### Next Steps:

1. **Fix ChatView Props in App.tsx**
   - Implement functions to retrieve project and chat names based on IDs
   - Add message state and message sending functionality

2. **Implement Context Controls Functionality**
   - Create ContextControlsPanel component
   - Connect toggle functions to actual functionality

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Connect Redux actions to API calls
   - Implement real data persistence for user prompts

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test all user prompt functionality
   - Ensure proper UX flow as described in the PDF documentation

This implementation successfully follows the design in the PDF document and maintains consistency with the existing components. The user prompts functionality is now integrated into the chat interface and ready for backend integration.
