# Scout Dev Log

## January 29, 2025 - Project Rebranding: Scout

### Major Decision: Named the AI Assistant "Scout"
The AI Assistant now has an official name: **Scout**. This name was chosen to reflect the application's core mission of helping users explore, discover, and navigate through their knowledge landscape.

#### Branding Implementation:
1. **Logo Design**:
   - Created a logo with circular "S" icon with gold border and subtle glow
   - Text uses gold gradient with shadow effect for depth
   - Clean, modern design that fits the existing color scheme

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md to introduce Scout
   - Added "Why Scout?" explanation to Scope.md
   - Changed all primary references from "AI Assistant" to "Scout"

3. **UI Changes**:
   - Sidebar now displays "SCOUT" with new logo design
   - Maintains gold (#d4af37) as primary brand color
   - Uses gradient effect for premium feel

The name "Scout" perfectly captures the essence of an AI that guides users through their data while maintaining complete privacy and local control.

## January 29, 2025 - Fixed Models Tab in Admin Panel

### Issue Fixed: Models Content Not Loading in Admin Settings
Fixed issue where the Models tab in the Admin Settings panel was not displaying model information.

#### Root Cause:
- API response structure mismatch between backend and frontend
- Backend returns `{ models: {...}, system: {...} }` format
- Frontend expected old structure with `data.ollama.models` array

#### Solution:
Updated `ModelsContent.tsx` to correctly parse the new API response structure:
- Changed from looking for `data.ollama.models` to `data.models`
- Convert models object to array format for display
- Extract model info from the correct fields in the response

The Models tab now properly displays all available models with their status, memory usage, and control buttons.

## January 28, 2025 - User Authentication System Planning

### Major Architecture Decision: Adding User Management
Planning implementation of a proper authentication system to replace the current password-based self-aware mode access.

#### System Design:
1. **User Roles**:
   - **Admin**: Full system access (all models, context modes, admin panel, database operations)
   - **User**: Standard access (Qwen model only, standard context modes, no admin features)

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - First-time setup wizard for initial admin account creation
   - Admin sets recovery PIN during setup (admin-only password recovery)
   - Login screen with username/password
   - 48-hour sessions with "Remember me" option
   - Session persists across browser restarts

3. **Access Control**:
   - Self-aware mode: Admin only (removes password prompt)
   - Model selection: Admin gets all models, Users get Qwen only
   - Admin panel: Admin only
   - Database operations: Admin only
   - Development mode: Admin only

4. **Project Collaboration**:
   - Any user can invite others to their projects
   - Upon invitation: All private contacts/documents convert to global (one-way)
   - Warning shown before conversion
   - Simplified visibility: Private (creator only) or Global (all project members)

5. **Development Considerations**:
   - Environment variable for dev mode bypass
   - Database seeding scripts for test users
   - Hot-reload friendly sessions
   - Quick user switching for testing
   - Keep feature flags for gradual rollout

6. **Security**:
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - JWT tokens for session management
   - No hardcoded accounts (good for open-source)
   - Admin recovery PIN as fallback

This removes the clunky self-aware password system and provides a professional, scalable authentication system suitable for team use.

## January 28, 2025 - Fixed Chat Bubble Styling Issue

### Issue Fixed: User Chat Bubbles Losing Yellow Color After Backend Restart
Fixed an issue where user chat bubbles would lose their yellow styling and appear with the same blue/gray styling as assistant messages after backend restart.

#### Root Cause:
1. **Color Mismatch**: ChatView component was using old gold color `#d4af37` instead of new yellow `#FCC000`
2. **Backend/Frontend Field Mismatch**: Backend sends `is_user` boolean field, but frontend expects `role` field with values 'user' or 'assistant'
3. **Missing Transformation**: chatService.ts wasn't transforming the backend format to frontend format

#### Solution:
1. Updated all color references in ChatView.tsx from `#d4af37` to `#FCC000`:
   - User message bubbles background
   - Model info text color
   - Loading spinner color
   - Button colors and borders
   
2. Added transformation in chatService.ts to convert backend `is_user` to frontend `role`:
   ```typescript
   // Transform is_user to role for each message
   response.data.messages = response.data.messages.map((msg: any) => ({
     ...msg,
     role: msg.is_user ? 'user' : 'assistant'
   }));
   ```
   
3. Updated timestamp handling to use actual `created_at` field from backend instead of generating new timestamps

Now user messages consistently display with yellow background (#FCC000) and assistant messages with blue background (#1a2b47), regardless of backend restarts.

## January 28, 2025 - Fixed Markdown/Text File Display in Chat

### Issue Fixed: Markdown and Text Files Breaking UI
Fixed an issue where .md and .txt files were not displaying properly in code blocks like Python files. The markdown files were being rendered as HTML, causing UI layout issues with large fonts and disappearing sidebars.

#### Root Cause:
- Backend was using 'markdown' and 'text' as language identifiers in code blocks
- Frontend ReactMarkdown component was interpreting these as content to render rather than display as code
- SyntaxHighlighter was treating 'markdown' differently than languages like 'python'

#### Solution:
Changed `simple_file_access.py` to use 'plaintext' language identifier for .md and .txt files:
- `.md`: 'plaintext' (was 'markdown')
- `.txt`: 'plaintext' (was 'text')
- This ensures all text-based files display consistently in dark code blocks

Now all file types (.py, .md, .txt, etc.) display uniformly in dark-themed code blocks with proper formatting.

## January 27, 2025 - Self-Aware File Reading & Syntax Highlighting

### Major Achievement: Working Self-Aware File Reading
Successfully implemented file reading capability that allows the AI to access and display local files from F:\assistant.

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Simplified File Access** (`simple_file_access.py`)
   - Works in ANY context mode (removed complex security boundaries)
   - Pattern matching for file requests
   - Full file content injection (no chunking for files < 5MB)
   - Supports all code file types (.py, .js, .ts, .md, .txt, etc.)

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Added file content injection to both regular and streaming chat endpoints
   - File content added as system message before user message
   - Logging shows successful file reads with content size

3. **Frontend Syntax Highlighting**
   - Installed react-markdown, remark-gfm, react-syntax-highlighter
   - Implemented proper markdown rendering in ChatView and TypewriterMessage
   - VS Code Dark+ theme with custom darker blue background (#0d1929)
   - Code blocks now have proper syntax highlighting:
     - Python: purple keywords, yellow functions, green comments
     - Markdown: proper header formatting
     - All languages supported by Prism

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - Code blocks have darker blue background that flows with chat UI
   - Subtle border (#1a2b47) matches assistant message background
   - Inline code also styled consistently
   - Maintains readability while looking cohesive

### Technical Decisions:
- Chose simplicity over complex security for local-only assistant
- Full file reading instead of chunking for better code context
- Markdown rendering for all assistant messages (user messages stay plain text)

### What Works Now:
- "show stop_assistant.py" - displays full file with syntax highlighting
- "read test.md" - shows markdown files properly formatted
- "display backend/app/main.py" - reads files from subdirectories
- All file types supported with appropriate syntax highlighting

## January 27, 2025 - Removed Llama 70B Model Support

### Reason: Hardware Incompatibility
NVIDIA NIM requires minimum 4x H100 GPUs (or 2x A100 80GB) for 70B models. Single RTX 4090 (24GB) cannot run it.

### Changes Made:
1. **Frontend**
   - Removed Llama 3.1 70B from model selection dropdowns
   - Removed from SystemModelsPanel and ElegantSystemModelsPanel
   - Removed from chat model selector

2. **Backend**
   - Removed from model_orchestrator.py
   - Removed BUSINESS_DEEP operational mode (70B-specific)
   - Removed special solo mode handling for 70B

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Removed nim-generation-70b container from docker-compose.yml
   - Deleted setup_llama_70b_nim.bat script
   - Updated start_assistant.py to remove 70B container checks

### Current Model Lineup:
- Qwen 2.5 32B (default)
- Mistral-Nemo 12B (fast)
- DeepSeek Coder V2 16B (code-focused)
- NV-EmbedQA (embeddings)

## January 27, 2025 - Self-Aware Context Implementation

### Major Features Added:
1. **Self-Aware API Endpoints** (`/api/self-aware/*`)
   - `GET /files` - List files in F:/assistant with security filtering
   - `GET /read` - Read file content with size limits and encoding detection
   - `POST /validate` - Validate code for dangerous patterns
   - `POST /update` - Update files with backup and audit trail
   - `GET /modifications` - View modification history

2. **Security Implementation**
   - Path traversal protection
   - Dangerous code pattern detection (exec, eval, subprocess, etc.)
   - Protected paths filtering (.git, .env, etc.)
   - File size limits (1MB max)
   - Automatic backup creation before modifications
   - Comprehensive audit logging

3. **Self-Aware Service**
   - Parses AI responses for file modification requests
   - Extracts code blocks and file paths
   - Creates diff previews
   - Validates modifications before applying
   - Formats human-readable summaries

4. **Integration Points**
   - Self-aware mode already exists in chat system
   - Ready for frontend UI implementation
   - Prepared for testing with DeepSeek model

### Security Considerations:
- All file operations confined to F:/assistant
- Dangerous patterns blocked: exec(), eval(), os.system(), subprocess, pickle
- Audit trail maintained in logs/file_modifications.jsonl
- Backup system for all file changes

### Next Steps:
- Create frontend UI for file browsing and diff approval
- Test with DeepSeek-coder model
- Add real-time file watching for external changes

## January 26, 2025 - UI Cleanup and Sidebar Improvements

### UI Refinements: Prompt Display Cleanup
Cleaned up redundant visual elements in the sidebar to reduce clutter and improve user experience.

1. **Sidebar Visual Updates:**
   - Changed the divider line above [CONTEXT SETTINGS] from dark to yellow (`border-yellow-500`)
   - Maintains visual consistency with the gold theme throughout the application

2. **Removed Redundant Prompt Indicators:**
   - **System Prompts Panel**: Removed the orange active prompt indicator badge
   - **User Prompts Panel**: Removed the gray/white active prompt indicator badge
   - Rationale: These indicators were redundant as the same information is clearly displayed under the chat window
   - Kept all configuration functionality intact - panels still manage prompts through Redux

3. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Removed unused imports from both SystemPromptsPanel and UserPromptsPanel
   - Removed `UserPromptIndicator` component references
   - Removed unused Redux selectors and dispatch calls
   - Simplified component logic by removing active prompt tracking in sidebar

4. **Architecture Verification:**
   - Confirmed proper separation of concerns:
     - Sidebar panels: Configuration and management of prompts
     - Chat window badges: Visual display of active prompts
   - Both systems operate independently through shared Redux state
   - No breaking changes to functionality

### Technical Details:
- Modified files:
  - `/frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` (yellow divider)
  - `/frontend/src/components/chat/SystemPromptsPanel.tsx` (removed indicator)
  - `/frontend/src/components/chat/UserPromptsPanel.tsx` (removed indicator)
- Result: Cleaner, less cluttered UI while maintaining full functionality

## January 26, 2025 - Resource Monitoring Implementation

### Major Feature: Real-time Resource Monitor in Top Bar
Implemented comprehensive resource monitoring display to replace "AI Assistant" text in header.

1. **Initial Implementation:**
   - Real-time VRAM usage display with progress bar
   - Active model name with status indicator
   - Token generation speed display
   - 2-second polling for updates

2. **Circular Gauge Redesign:**
   - Created CircularGauge component matching the design from chat.jpg
   - Four circular gauges with color-coded themes:
     - **GPU (NVIDIA Green #76B900)**: VRAM usage monitoring
     - **CPU (AMD Red #ED1C24 / Intel Blue #0078D4)**: CPU utilization
     - **RAM (Purple #9B59B6)**: Memory usage tracking
     - **HDD (Gray #6C757D)**: Storage space monitoring
   - Each gauge shows numeric value in center with label below
   - Brand names displayed under each gauge (NVIDIA, AMD/Intel, Memory, Storage)

3. **Visual Design:**
   - Circular progress indicators with smooth animations
   - Consistent 50px gauge size with 5px stroke width
   - Model info and stats displayed separately after divider
   - Compact layout fits perfectly in top bar

4. **Integration:**
   - Replaced "AI Assistant" header text with ResourceMonitor
   - Sidebar retains "AI Assistant" title as branding
   - Mock data for CPU/RAM/HDD (backend endpoints pending)
   - Real GPU/VRAM data from existing endpoints

### Technical Implementation:
- Components: 
  - `/frontend/src/components/common/ResourceMonitor.tsx`
  - `/frontend/src/components/common/CircularGauge.tsx`
- Service updates: 
  - Added `getQuickModelStatus()` to modelService
  - Added `getSystemResources()` to systemService (for future use)
- Polling interval: 2 seconds for responsive updates

## May 26, 2025 - NVIDIA NV-Ingest Integration Decision

### Strategic Decision: Advanced Document Processing with NV-Ingest
1. **Why NV-Ingest over Simple Libraries:**
   - **Multimodal Extraction**: Handles text, tables, charts, and images from PDFs/DOCX
   - **15x Performance**: Enterprise-grade speed vs traditional extraction
   - **Future-Proof**: No need to migrate data when scaling up
   - **Smart Loading**: Only loads models needed for specific file types
   - **RTX 4090 Optimized**: Leverages GPU for maximum performance

2. **Smart Model Loading Strategy:**
   - TXT/Code: Direct extraction (0GB VRAM, instant)
   - DOCX: YOLOX + DePlot for charts/tables (4-6GB VRAM, 8-10s)
   - PDF: Full suite including OCR (10-12GB VRAM, 15-20s)
   - XLSX: DePlot for chart extraction (2-3GB VRAM, 5s)

3. **VRAM Management Considerations:**
   - Total models: 6-12GB during processing (fits within 24GB)
   - Models load on-demand, unload when idle
   - No competition with LLMs - documents process separately
   - User gets visual feedback during model loading

4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Add NV-Ingest container to docker-compose.yml
   - Create processing status WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Enhance ProcessingStatusPanel with model loading progress
   - Implement smart routing based on file extension

## May 26, 2025 - Document Extraction Bug Discovery

### Critical Bug Found:
1. **Document content not being extracted**
   - Documents (DOCX, PDF, etc.) were storing placeholder text instead of actual content
   - Root cause: `processor.py` had placeholder implementations that were never completed
   - This explains why AI couldn't access document content despite successful embeddings
   
2. **Investigation Results:**
   - Both current code AND backup had the same placeholders
   - Text extraction was NEVER implemented, not a regression
   - System was creating embeddings of placeholder text like "[Word document content would be extracted here...]"
   - This is why switching from sentence-transformers to NIM "broke" document retrieval

## May 26, 2025 - Full Migration to NIM Embeddings & Enhanced Document Processing

### Major Changes:
1. **Completely removed sentence-transformers**
   - No more fallback - NIM is now required
   - Removed all sentence-transformers references from code
   - Updated embedding service to require NIM
   - Fixed NIM integration issues (async health check, method names)

2. **Database migration to 1024 dimensions**
   - Changed vector column from 768 to 1024 dimensions
   - Reset all document processing flags
   - Ready for NIM's higher-dimensional embeddings
   - Discovered NIM requires very low similarity thresholds (0.01 vs 0.3)

3. **Enhanced Document Chunking System**
   - Increased default chunk size from 1000 to 3000 characters (3x improvement)
   - Implemented auto-detect document chunking based on filename patterns
   - Business documents get multiple chunk sizes (3000 + 8000 chars)
   - Technical documents get specialized chunking (3000 + 5000 chars)
   - Default documents use standard 3000 char chunks

4. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Auto-chunking is default, no user configuration needed
   - Context modes (Quick/Standard/Deep) will automatically use appropriate chunk sizes
   - Optional manual override available during upload (future feature)

### Technical Discoveries:
- NIM embeddings use different normalization than traditional models
- Similarity scores are much lower (0.05 = excellent match vs 0.7-0.9 traditional)
- NIM optimized for ranking rather than absolute similarity scores
- Both query and passage embeddings require explicit input_type parameter

### Breaking Changes:
- NIM container MUST be running on port 8081
- All existing embeddings were deleted (documents preserved)
- Documents need to be re-processed with NIM
- Minimum similarity threshold changed from 0.3 to 0.01

### Architecture Decisions:
- Chose simplicity over complexity for chunking UI
- Default to "auto-detect" with optional overrides
- Context modes drive chunk selection, not user configuration
- Multi-level chunking only for documents that benefit from it

### Next Steps:
- Test document upload with new auto-chunking
- Implement context mode integration (Deep Research → large chunks)
- Add optional document type override in upload UI
- Turn off "Global Data" context by default (only use project documents)

## May 26, 2025 - NIM Embeddings Integration

### Improvements:
1. **Added NIM embeddings with automatic fallback**
   - Configured system to use NVIDIA NIM embeddings (NV-EmbedQA-E5-V5) as primary
   - Automatic fallback to sentence-transformers when NIM service unavailable
   - Fixed async/await issue in embedding service health check
   
2. **Enhanced embeddings visibility**
   - Added sentence-transformers to models UI as "EMBEDDING FALLBACK"
   - Shows current embedding model status and memory usage
   - Both models use compatible 768-dimensional vectors

### Status:
- NIM embedding service needs to run on port 8001 for NIM usage
- Currently using sentence-transformers as fallback (working correctly)
- Document retrieval confirmed working with semantic search

## January 25, 2025 - Performance Optimizations and Document Context Fixes

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Slow chat loading** - Model status check was taking ~10 seconds
2. **Chat title showing "unknown"** - Chat names weren't loaded before display
3. **Documents not being used in chat context** - Document retrieval had issues

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Optimized Model Status Checking
- Added `get_quick_model_status()` method in ModelOrchestrator that returns minimal info
- Added VRAM caching with 5-second refresh interval to avoid repeated GPU queries
- Created new `/api/models/status/quick` endpoint for frontend
- Updated ChatView to use quick status first, then load full model list in background

#### 2. Fixed Chat Title Display
- Modified `getChatName()` in App.tsx to show "Loading..." instead of "Unknown Chat"
- Added logic to update chat names when chat data is loaded
- Ensures chat name is populated when navigating to a specific chat

#### 3. Enhanced Document Context Retrieval
- Added debugging logs to document search in chat endpoint
- Lowered similarity threshold from 0.6 to 0.3 for better document recall
- Added check for processed documents in project before searching
- Improved error logging with full stack traces
- Added similarity scores to document context display
- Created debug endpoint `/api/files/debug/project-documents/{project_id}` to check document processing status

### Technical Details:
- VRAM usage is now cached and updated every 5 seconds
- Document search now retrieves top 5 chunks but only uses top 3
- Context mode controls are respected (quick-response mode skips documents)
- Better error handling and logging throughout the document pipeline

## January 25, 2025 - Icon Fixes and File Processing Updates

### Fixed View Icon Path
- **Problem**: view.svg icon was not displaying properly in file managers
- **Cause**: Icon component referenced `/icons/View.SVG` with incorrect capitalization
- **Solution**: Updated to `/icons/view.svg` to match actual filename in public/icons directory

### Fixed Infinite Polling in ProjectFileManager
- **Problem**: File status polling continued indefinitely, flooding backend with requests
- **Cause**: useEffect dependency was only checking array length, not actual processing status
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed dependency to track specific processing file IDs
  - Only polls when there are actually files in processing state
  - Stops immediately when all files are processed or failed
  - More efficient tracking prevents unnecessary re-renders

### Fixed Chat Creation Error Handling
- **Problem**: Chat creation failures resulted in fake chat IDs that caused 404 errors
- **Cause**: chatService was creating fallback chats with Date.now() IDs when backend errors occurred
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed fallback chat creation in chatService
  - Now properly throws errors when chat creation fails
  - Frontend will need to handle errors and ensure valid project_id is always provided

### Fixed Chat Creation Schema Mismatch
- **Problem**: Chat creation failed with TypeError: 'context_settings' is an invalid keyword argument
- **Cause**: ChatCreate schema included context_settings field but Chat model didn't have this column
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified base repository create method to filter out fields not in the model
  - Now only passes fields that exist in the database model
  - Prevents schema/model mismatches from causing 500 errors

### Performance and UX Improvements
- **Optimized Model Status Check**:
  - Added fast endpoint `/system/active-model-quick` with 5-second caching
  - Reduced model check time from ~10 seconds to <100ms
  - Added `getActiveModelQuick()` method to systemService
  - Fixed model name mismatch (qwen-2.5-coder:32b → qwen2.5:32b-instruct-q4_K_M)
  - Added caching for available models to prevent multiple API calls
- **Fixed Chat Title Display**:
  - Chat names now update immediately when creating new chats
  - Added chat to chatNames map during creation
  - Changed "Unknown Chat" to "Loading..." for better UX
- **Enhanced Document Debug**:
  - Added `/chats/debug/documents/{project_id}` endpoint
  - Shows document processing status and chunk counts
  - Fixed DocumentChunk import issue
  - Documents are confirmed processed with chunks
- **Document Search Investigation**:
  - Confirmed documents are processed and have chunks
  - Semantic search returns no results even with low threshold (0.1)
  - Issue appears to be with embedding storage or retrieval in pgvector
  - Chat endpoint already uses 0.3 similarity threshold

## January 25, 2025 - Drag and Drop & File Processing Fixes
### Fixed Drag and Drop in ProjectFileManager
- **Problem**: Drag and drop area was just visual placeholder, files would open instead of uploading
- **Solution**: Added proper drag event handlers:
  - `onDragOver` - Prevents default behavior and shows visual feedback
  - `onDragEnter` - Activates drag state
  - `onDragLeave` - Deactivates drag state  
  - `onDrop` - Handles file upload to project
- **Features Added**:
  - Visual feedback during drag (gold border and background)
  - New `isDragging` state for UI updates
  - `handleDroppedFiles` function that opens TagAndAddFileModal
  - Files passed to modal via `preDroppedFiles` prop
  - Modal allows adding descriptions before upload

### Fixed File Processing Status Updates
- **Problems Fixed**:
  - Files showed "Processing..." indefinitely
  - Files didn't appear until page refresh
  - No dynamic updates when processing completed
- **Solutions**:
  - Added separate useEffect for polling processing status
  - Polls every 2 seconds when files are processing
  - Automatically stops polling when all files are processed
  - Clear separation of concerns between file list and status updates
  - Fixed closure issue with projectFiles state in polling logic

## January 25, 2025

### Fixed pgvector Document Search Issue
Resolved critical issue where documents attached to projects weren't being used in chat context due to incorrect embedding storage:

1. **Problem Identification**
   - Documents were processed and chunks created, but semantic search returned no results
   - Embeddings were stored as JSON text strings instead of pgvector vector type
   - DocumentChunk model used Text column instead of Vector column type

2. **Database Migration**
   - Created migration script to convert embedding column from Text to Vector(768)
   - Migration handles existing embeddings by parsing JSON and converting to pgvector format
   - Added proper pgvector index for efficient similarity search
   - Script: `backend/app/db/migrations/fix_embedding_column.py`

3. **Model Updates**
   - Updated DocumentChunk model to use `Vector(768)` column type
   - Added pgvector SQLAlchemy import
   - Fixed embedding storage in `process_document_background`

4. **Vector Store Improvements**
   - Updated `update_document_embedding` to work with pgvector directly
   - Fixed similarity search to properly format query vectors
   - Removed unnecessary JSON string conversions

5. **Testing Tools**
   - Created `run_embedding_migration.py` for easy migration execution
   - Created `test_pgvector_search.py` to verify pgvector functionality
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

This fix enables proper semantic search functionality, allowing the AI assistant to use project documents in chat responses as intended.

### Implemented Document Context in Chat Responses
Connected the document retrieval system to the chat interface so documents are actually used:

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Added document context fields to ChatGenerateRequest schema
   - Implemented semantic search in generate_chat_response_stream endpoint
   - Retrieves top 5 most relevant document chunks based on user query
   - Supports both project-scoped and global document search
   - Adds relevant chunks to chat context with similarity scores

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Updated ChatGenerateRequest interface with document context settings
   - Modified App.tsx to pass chat settings to the streaming API
   - Connected Redux chat settings to the API calls
   - Document context toggles now control actual behavior

3. **How It Works**
   - When "Project Documents Enabled" is on, searches project documents
   - When "Global Data Enabled" is on, searches all documents system-wide
   - User's message is converted to embedding vector
   - Semantic search finds most relevant chunks (similarity > 0.3)
   - Relevant chunks are added to the chat context
   - AI uses this context to provide informed responses

The AI assistant can now access and use document content when answering questions, making it truly context-aware.

### Identified Redux/Navigation Timing Issue
Discovered recurring pattern of crashes when accessing chat settings:

1. **Symptoms**
   - "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors when navigating to chats
   - Particularly after deleting chats or rapid navigation
   - Redux state not initialized before component renders

2. **Root Cause**
   - Navigation state (activeChatId) and Redux state (currentChatId) are separate
   - Components render before Redux updates complete
   - Race condition: Navigation → Render → Redux (should be Navigation → Redux → Render)

3. **Current Mitigation**
   - Fixed property name mismatch (settingsByChat vs chats)
   - Added setCurrentChat dispatch when loading chat messages
   - Added defensive null checks with optional chaining
   - This is a "good enough" fix but not architecturally sound

4. **Proper Solution (Future)**
   - Unify navigation state into Redux as single source of truth
   - Add middleware to block navigation until Redux is ready
   - Implement proper loading states in components
   - This would require significant refactoring of navigation system

This issue is documented in implementation.md for future architectural improvements.

### Fixed SQLAlchemy Session Issue in Document Retrieval
The document context feature was failing with "Instance is not bound to a Session" error:

1. **Root Cause**: Accessing `chat.project_id` inside async generator after session closed
2. **Fix**: Capture `project_id_for_context` before entering generator
3. **Result**: Document retrieval now works perfectly!

### Discovered Embedding Model Mismatch
Found that we're using sentence-transformers instead of the superior NVIDIA NIM embeddings:

1. **Current State**: 
   - Using: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 (109M params)
   - Available: NVIDIA NV-EmbedQA-E5-V5 (335M params, already running!)

2. **Impact**: Missing better semantic understanding (e.g., motorcycle→vehicle)

3. **Planned Improvements**:
   - Make embedding models visible in UI
   - Switch to NIM embeddings as default
   - Keep sentence-transformers as fallback option

### Identified File Active/Inactive Toggle Issue
The active/inactive toggle doesn't actually prevent files from being searched:

1. **Conceptual Confusion**: What does "inactive" mean if files are still searchable?
2. **Proposed Solution**: Remove toggle, keep only attach/detach
3. **Benefit**: Clearer mental model - attached files are searchable, detached aren't

## 1/26/2025

### Updated Embedding Dimensions for NIM (768 → 1024)
Updated all embedding dimension references from 768 to 1024 to match NVIDIA NIM embeddings:

1. **Files Updated**:
   - `/backend/app/rag/vector_store.py`: EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS constant
   - `/backend/app/api/endpoints/system.py`: Fallback embedding dimension and model info display
   - `/backend/app/services/embedding_service.py`: Documentation comments
   - `/backend/app/db/models/document.py`: DocumentChunk embedding column (Vector(1024))

2. **Impact**: 
   - Ensures consistency with NIM's 1024-dimensional embeddings
   - Database schema now correctly reflects the embedding size
   - Note: This requires a database migration to update existing vectors

## 1/26/2025 - Resource Monitoring and Chat UI Fixes

### Implemented System Resource Monitoring
Added real-time system resource monitoring to the main display header:

1. **Created Components**:
   - `ResourceMonitor.tsx`: Main monitoring component with 10-second polling

   - CPU usage with brand detection (Intel blue, AMD orange)
   - RAM usage (purple) with whole number capacity display
   - Storage monitoring (white) with M.2 drive detection
   - Horizontal bar design matching chat.jpg aesthetic

3. **Backend Logging Fix**:
   - Modified `run_server.py` to filter only resource monitoring endpoints
   - Keeps all other logs visible while preventing console spam
   - Resource logs still written to separate file

### Fixed Chat Message Formatting
Restored proper chat message styling:

1. **Label Fix**: Changed user message label from "You" to "Assistant" (matching chat.jpg)
2. **Color Fix**: User messages now display with:
   - Dark background (#1a1a1a)
   - Yellow/gold text (#d4af37)
   - Red border (2px solid #cc0000)
3. **Maintained**: Assistant messages keep blue background with white text

### Fixed Backend Console Output Issues
Resolved multiple console logging problems:

1. **Restored Colors**: Added ColoredFormatter with colorama support
   - INFO messages show in green
   - ERROR messages show in red
   - HTTP status codes are colored (200=green, 307=yellow, 404/500=red)
   
2. **Fixed Resource Endpoint Filtering**: 
   - Updated ConsoleFilter to properly detect access log format
   - Now correctly filters /api/models/status/quick and /api/system/resources
   
3. **Prevented Double Messages**:
   - Properly configured uvicorn access logger with separate handler
   - Added lifespan="on" to prevent duplicate startup messages

These settings are now uniquely tied to each chat thread and will be remembered as users navigate between different chats within projects.

## 5/27/2025 - Enhanced Resource Monitoring Log Filtering

### Improved Resource Endpoint Filtering
Fixed resource monitoring endpoints flooding the backend console:

1. **Updated logging_filter.py**:
   - Enhanced ResourceEndpointFilter to properly suppress console output
   - Added automatic file logging to `backend/logs/resource_monitoring.log`
   - Implemented RotatingFileHandler (10MB max, 3 backups)
   
2. **Simplified run_server.py**:
   - Now imports and uses the centralized ResourceEndpointFilter
   - Properly configures uvicorn's logging config
   - Applied filter to uvicorn.access logger

3. **Filtered Endpoints**:
   - `/api/models/status/quick`
   - `/api/system/resources` 
   - `/api/models/memory`
   - `/api/system/gpu-stats`

Result: Resource monitoring logs are now silently written to a log file while keeping the console clean for important messages.

   - Added timestamps for every request (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)
   - Friendly action names for common operations
   - Status indicators (✓ for success, ✗ for errors)
   - No external dependencies or extra files

2. **Action Name Mapping**:
   - Upload Document - File uploads
   - Process Document - Document processing  
   - Chat Message - User chat interactions
   - List Files - File browsing
   - Search Documents - Semantic search
   - Project/Model/System operations

3. **Console Output Format**:
   ```
   [2025-05-27 10:52:10] ✓ Upload Document - INFO: 127.0.0.1:52974 - "POST /api/files/upload HTTP/1.1" 200
   [2025-05-27 10:52:11] ✓ Process Document - INFO: 127.0.0.1:52975 - "POST /api/files/123/process HTTP/1.1" 200

### 3. Technical Clarifications
- Confirmed current document processing uses PyPDF2/python-docx (simple approach)
- NV-Ingest multimodal extraction noted as future consideration
- Documented the distinction between current and planned implementations
## 2025-05-27 - Removed Llama 70B Model Support

- Removed Llama 3.1 70B model from UI model selection panels
- Removed 70B model configuration from backend model orchestrator
- Removed BUSINESS_DEEP operational mode that was specific to 70B
- Removed nim-generation-70b container from docker-compose.yml
- Deleted setup_llama_70b_nim.bat script
- Updated start_assistant.py to remove 70B container checks

Reason: NVIDIA NIM requires minimum 4x H100 GPUs for 70B model, not compatible with single RTX 4090

## 2025-05-27 - Fixed Model Status Synchronization

- Fixed issue where model status wasn't updating in AI Models page when switching models in chat
- Added model switching logic to both chat endpoints (regular and streaming)
- Modified LLM service to call orchestrator.switch_to_model() before using a model
- Now when a user selects a model in chat, it properly loads and updates status to 'loaded'
- Models will correctly show as active (green dot) in the AI Models page when in use

## May 28, 2025 - Self-Aware Write Permissions Implementation

### Major Feature: Full Write Access in Self-Aware Mode
Implemented comprehensive file write and command execution capabilities with mandatory individual approval for every action.

#### Security Implementation:
1. **Password Authentication** (`self_aware_auth.py`)
   - Password-protected self-aware mode (default: "dev-mode-2024")
   - 1-hour session tokens with automatic expiration
   - Session management with cleanup of expired tokens

2. **Mandatory Individual Approvals** (`action_approval.py`)
   - Every file write requires explicit user approval
   - Every command execution requires explicit user approval
   - NO batch approvals - each action approved separately
   - WebSocket support for real-time approval notifications
   - 5-minute timeout for approval requests

3. **File Access Control** (`secure_file_ops.py`)
   - Write operations restricted to F:\ drive only
   - Command execution allowed from any path (for system tools)
   - Dangerous code pattern detection (exec, eval, subprocess, etc.)
   - Automatic backups before file modifications
   - Protected paths (.git, .env, node_modules, etc.)

4. **Chat Integration** (`self_aware_integration.py`)
   - AI responses automatically parsed for file/command operations
   - Pattern matching for code blocks and commands
   - Actions submitted to approval queue
   - Status messages injected into chat responses

#### Frontend Implementation:
1. **Visual Indicators**
   - Bright red context badge with "🔴 SELF-AWARE" text
   - Pulsing animation for high visibility
   - Warning tooltip about F:\ drive access

2. **Action Approval Modal**
   - Detailed preview of file changes with syntax highlighting
   - Command execution details with risk assessment
   - Individual approve/deny buttons for each action
   - No "approve all" functionality by design

3. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Real-time approval notifications
   - Automatic reconnection on disconnect
   - Action queue management

#### How It Works:
1. User selects "Self-Aware" from context mode
2. Password modal appears for authentication
3. Upon correct password, mode activates with red badge
4. AI can suggest file modifications or commands
5. Each suggestion triggers an approval modal
6. User must individually approve/deny each action
7. Approved actions execute with full audit trail

#### Security Features:
- ✅ Password protection required
- ✅ F:\ drive write restrictions
- ✅ Individual approval for EVERY action
- ✅ No batch approvals possible
- ✅ Automatic file backups
- ✅ Dangerous code pattern detection
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions
- ✅ 1-hour session timeout

#### Technical Notes:
- Authorization header properly passed in chat requests
- Self-aware token stored in localStorage
- WebSocket connects after authentication
- File operations limited to F:\ for safety
- Commands can access C:\ tools but not write there

#### Configuration Notes:
- Password can be set via SELF_AWARE_PASSWORD in backend/.env file
- The Settings class in config.py must include SELF_AWARE_PASSWORD field
- Import must use absolute path: `from app.core.config import settings`
- Backend automatically loads .env file via Pydantic Settings
- Fixed z-index issue where password modal appeared behind context modal
- **IMPORTANT**: The current password is set to `"patrik"` in backend/.env (overrides default "dev-mode-2024")

#### Known Issues Resolved:
- Fixed ImportError by using absolute imports instead of relative
- Fixed Pydantic validation error by adding SELF_AWARE_PASSWORD to Settings class
- Password modal now appears on top with z-[100] z-index

## May 28, 2025 - Resolved Self-Aware Login Issue

### Issue: Invalid Password Error
- User reported being unable to login to self-aware mode with "invalid password" error
- Investigation revealed password is set in backend/.env file as `SELF_AWARE_PASSWORD="patrik"`
- This overrides the default password "dev-mode-2024" set in config.py
- Solution: Removed the ENV entry to use default password "dev-mode-2024"
- Backend restart required after .env modification

### Frontend API Path Issue Fixed
- Discovered frontend was using incorrect API path: `/api/self-aware/authenticate`
- This resulted in double `/api` in the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/api/self-aware/authenticate`)
- No backend logs appeared because the request never reached the correct endpoint
- Fixed by:
  1. Importing `selfAwareService` in ContextControlsPanel.tsx
  2. Using `selfAwareService.authenticate()` instead of direct fetch
  3. This ensures proper API base URL handling
- Authentication now works correctly with password "dev-mode-2024"

## May 28, 2025 - Fixed Self-Aware Mode Badge Display

### Issue: Badge Not Updating to Red After Authentication
- User reported that after successful self-aware authentication, the badge still showed "Context: Standard" in yellow
- The mode was actually active (file reading worked) but the UI didn't reflect it

### Fix Applied:
- Updated `handlePasswordSubmit` in ContextControlsPanel to call `onApplySettings(selfAwareSettings)`
- This ensures the Redux store is updated immediately after authentication
- The badge now correctly shows red "🔴 SELF-AWARE" after login

### File Write Issue with DeepSeek Model:
- DeepSeek model provides Python scripts instead of triggering file writes
- The self-aware integration parser expects specific patterns:
  - `write to filename.ext: ```content````
  - `save to filename.ext: ```content````
  - `update filename.ext with: ```content````
- DeepSeek needs prompt engineering to output in the expected format
- Consider adding a system prompt for self-aware mode to guide the AI's response format

## May 28, 2025 - Chat Context Improvements & Personal Profiles Implementation

### Major Chat Context Improvements

#### 1. Fixed Duplicate Message Bug
Resolved critical issue where user messages appeared twice in the AI's context:

**Problem**: 
- Messages were saved to database then immediately included in context fetch
- AI was processing the same message twice, causing confusion and redundant responses

**Solution**:
- Modified `chats.py` to filter out the just-saved message from context
- Applied to both regular and streaming chat endpoints
```python
# Filter out the message we just saved to avoid duplication
filtered_messages = [
    msg for msg in recent_messages 
    if msg.id != user_msg_obj.id
][:request.context_messages]
```

#### 2. Extended Context Window from 10 to 100 Messages
Dramatically improved the AI's ability to maintain context during long conversations:

**Problem**:
- Context window limited to 10 messages (5 exchanges)
- Large content (transcripts, documents) would fall out of context quickly
- Users had to repeatedly re-paste information

**Solution**:
- Increased `context_messages` from 10 to 100 in chat endpoints
- All models support this (Qwen: 32K tokens, Mistral: 128K tokens, DeepSeek: 16K tokens)
- Minimal resource impact (~200KB RAM per chat)

**Benefits**:
- Transcripts and large documents stay in context throughout conversation
- No need to re-paste information during extended discussions
- Better continuity for complex problem-solving sessions

### Complete Personal Profiles Implementation

Implemented a comprehensive personal profiles system allowing users to maintain context about people they interact with:

#### 1. Database Schema
Created `personal_profiles` table with:
- **Core Fields**: name, preferred_name, relationship (colleague/family/friend/client)
- **Organization Info**: organization, role
- **Important Dates**: birthday, first_met
- **Communication**: preferred_contact (email/phone/teams/slack), timezone
- **Context**: current_focus, notes (markdown supported)
- **Privacy**: visibility levels (private/shared/global)

#### 2. Visibility Model
- **🔒 Private**: Only visible to the profile owner
- **👥 Shared**: Visible to project collaborators (future feature)
- **🌍 Global**: Visible to all users in the system

#### 3. API Implementation
Complete REST API with:
- `GET /personal-profiles/` - List profiles with visibility filtering
- `POST /personal-profiles/` - Create new profile
- `PUT /personal-profiles/{id}` - Update existing profile
- `DELETE /personal-profiles/{id}` - Soft delete (sets is_active=false)
- `GET /personal-profiles/search` - Search profiles by name
- `GET /personal-profiles/context` - Get profiles formatted for chat context

#### 4. Frontend UI
- **Access**: "People" button in main header (person icon)
- **Modal Design**: 
  - Clean form with all fields organized in grid layout
  - Visibility selector with emoji indicators
  - Markdown-supported notes field
  - Card-based display of existing profiles
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, error handling, success notifications

#### 5. Chat Integration
Profiles automatically enhance chat conversations:
- Profiles included in chat context based on visibility
- Formatted as structured information for the LLM
- Example usage: "What should I discuss with Johan?" - AI uses profile context
- Works in both standard and streaming chat endpoints

#### 6. Service Layer
`PersonalProfileService` handles:
- Profile formatting for chat context
- Visibility-based filtering
- User-scoped queries
- Context string generation for LLM consumption

### Hardware Discussion
User asked about hardware upgrades. Key insights:
- **GPU Compute** is the primary bottleneck, not storage or RAM
- Current RTX 4090 (24GB) is well-utilized
- Second GPU recommendation: RTX 4060 Ti 16GB for dedicated embeddings
- This would free up main GPU for LLM inference
- Storage (NVMe) and RAM (64GB) are already sufficient

### Documentation Updates
Updated all project documentation to reflect today's changes:

#### 1. implementation.md
- Added "Personal Profiles System" section with complete architecture
- Updated implementation status table (Personal Profiles: 100% complete)
- Added chat context window improvements to Chat System section
- Documented message deduplication fix

#### 2. Scope.md
- Added "Personal Context Memory" as Core Capability #8
- Described the human-centric knowledge base concept
- Listed key features and visibility controls

#### 3. Readme.MD
- Added personal profiles to Key Features list
- Created new "Personal Profiles" section with usage instructions
- Explained visibility settings and how the feature works
- Updated feature list with extended context memory

### Technical Achievements Today
1. ✅ Resolved duplicate message bug affecting AI responses
2. ✅ 10x improvement in context retention (10→100 messages)
3. ✅ Complete personal profiles implementation (DB, API, UI)
4. ✅ Automatic chat context integration with visibility controls
5. ✅ Comprehensive documentation updates
6. ✅ Hardware optimization consultation

### Migration Required
To use the new personal profiles feature:
```bash
cd backend
python app/db/migrations/update_personal_profiles_schema.py
```

This creates the necessary database table and enum types for the visibility system.

## 2025-05-29 - UI Styling Updates & Claude Code Memory Management

### Claude Code Memory Management
Learned about Claude Code's built-in memory features for preserving context across WSL/system reboots:
- **Project Memory** (`./CLAUDE.md`): Team-shared instructions checked into codebase
- **User Memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Personal preferences across all projects  
- **Memory Imports**: Can use `@path/to/file` syntax for recursive memory loading
- **Quick Commands**:
  - `#` shortcut for quick memory additions during sessions
  - `/memory` command for editing memory files directly
- Created `sessions/` directory with timestamped memory files for session tracking
- Added SESSION MEMORY section to CLAUDE.md to track important discussions

### UI Styling Enhancements
Applied consistent visual styling to modals:
- **Admin Settings Panel**: Added `rounded-2xl` corners and `border-2 border-yellow-500` frame
- **Universal Search Modal**: Same rounded corners and 2px yellow border treatment  
- **System Models Panel** (ElegantSystemModelsPanel): Matching style for visual consistency

These changes create a cohesive visual theme across all modal windows with rounded corners and distinctive yellow borders.
