- Created service classes for projects and user prompts
- Set up API client configuration for local development

## May 15, 2025 - File Management System Implementation

### Key Initiative
Completing the frontend-backend integration for the file management system

### Action Items Completed
1. **File Service API Layer**
   - Designed TypeScript interfaces for all file data structures
   - Implemented RESTful methods for file operations
   - Added proper error handling and type safety throughout

2. **UI Components Integration**
   - Updated three key file management components to use the new API services:
     - MainFileManager: Refactored to use live data instead of mocks
     - ProjectFileManager: Connected to project-specific endpoints
     - SearchFilesResults: Enhanced with backend search capabilities

### Technical Notes
- All components follow optimistic UI update patterns for better perceived performance
- Added consistent error handling with user-friendly messages
- Implemented proper loading states throughout the interface
- Applied consistent data mapping between API and UI structures
- File type visualization and iconography standardized across components

## May 16, 2025 - Removing Mock Data and Planning Backend-Frontend Integration Completion
