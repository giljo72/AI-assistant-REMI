### Key Initiative: Refining our understanding and implementation of the Project-Centered Containment approach

#### Action items and activities
- Reviewed existing implementation of the UI components
- Identified misalignment between current implementation and intended project-centered containment model
- Updated core documentation to clearly define containment approach
- Analyzed the assistant-projectv2.pdf design document to better understand the intended UI workflow
- Updated project architecture to formalize "containment by default, expansion by choice" principle
- Consolidated our understanding of project-specific chats and document attachments

#### Technical Decisions
- Refined the project-centered containment model without changing the core tech stack
- Determined that PostgreSQL with pgvector remains appropriate for implementing project-centered retrieval
- Decided to maintain the UI-first implementation approach with progressive enhancement
- Created a dedicated implementation phase for project-centered components
- Established a clearer data model for project-chat and project-document relationships
- Defined a more explicit visual approach for indicating project context in the UI

#### Challenges Encountered
- Current UI implementation was displaying all chats regardless of project context
- Project sidebar wasn't showing clear containment relationships
- Needed to better articulate the relationship between projects, chats, and documents
- Required clearer definitions for when and how users can expand beyond project boundaries
- Working out the balance between containment for better performance and expansion for broader knowledge

#### Architecture Refinements
- **Project-First Containment**: Projects are self-contained knowledge environments with their own chats and attached documents
- **Selective Expansion**: Users can explicitly opt to expand beyond containment boundaries via context controls
- **Performance Benefits**: Containment limits context scope by default for better performance
- **Visual Indicators**: UI will clearly show project context and when expanded context is being used
- **Future Extensions**: The same containment/expansion model will apply to external integrations

#### Next Steps
- Update the ProjectManagerView component to properly show only chats from the active project
- Implement a project-specific file attachment system
- Create modals for attaching files to projects, deleting projects, and modifying projects
- Build a proper context controls component with project containment awareness
- Implement visual indicators for project context throughout the UI
- Continue with the UI-first implementation approach, ensuring all components respect project boundaries
