# Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Current Issues
1. Information is scattered across multiple documents
2. Implementation details mixed with scope/vision
3. Unclear what's actually implemented vs planned
4. Test scripts and one-time utilities cluttering the project
5. No clear path forward for NIM multimodal integration

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Scope.md - WHAT & WHY (Vision & Intent)
- Project vision and philosophy
- Core features and capabilities (high-level)
- User value propositions
- Success criteria
- NO implementation details

### 2. Implementation.md - HOW (Technical Plan)
- Current implementation approach
- Alternative approaches considered
- Upgrade paths and future enhancements
- Technical architecture decisions
- Progress tracking with checkboxes
- Clear section on NIM multimodal exploration

### 3. Devlog.md - WHAT WE DID (Historical Record)
- Chronological development history
- Major decisions and pivots
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Keep as-is but add summary section at top

### 4. README.md - QUICK START (For New Users)
- What the project does (1 paragraph)
- Key features (bullet points)
- Quick start guide
- Basic usage examples
- Links to other docs

### 5. Project_Structure.md - NEW (File Organization)
- Complete file tree with descriptions
- Folder purposes
- Key file explanations
- Module dependencies

### 6. Cleanup_Opportunities.md - NEW (Tech Debt)
- List of test scripts and their purposes
- One-time setup scripts
- Deprecated code
- Cleanup recommendations

## NIM Multimodal Integration Next Steps

### Document Processing Evolution Path
1. **Current State**: PyPDF2 + python-docx (text only)
2. **Next Phase**: NIM embeddings with better text extraction
3. **Future Vision**: Full NIM multimodal with:
   - NVIDIA NV-Ingest for document intelligence
   - Chart/table extraction with YOLOX
   - OCR with PaddleOCR
   - Visual understanding with C-RADIO

### Clear Action Items for NIM Exploration
1. Research NV-Ingest Docker deployment
2. Test multimodal extraction on sample PDFs
3. Benchmark VRAM requirements
4. Create proof-of-concept integration
5. Document API differences and migration path

## Immediate Actions
1. Run backup script (E:\root\assistant_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
2. Reorganize documentation per this plan
3. Create missing documents (Project_Structure.md, Cleanup_Opportunities.md)
4. Update Implementation.md with clear NIM roadmap
5. Clean up test scripts and one-time utilities
