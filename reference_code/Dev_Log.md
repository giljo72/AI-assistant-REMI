Applied consistent styling for all interactive elements



Technical Challenges

Gradio 5.29.0 API compatibility issues (lack of Box component)
Button layout and alignment challenges in flexible containers
Text truncation with proper overflow handling
Component visibility and event propagation

Current Issues for Future Work

Project box background styling needs further refinement
