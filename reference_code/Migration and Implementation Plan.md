✅ Memory scope toggles (Global Chats, Global Documents, All)
✅ Context buttons (Document Context, Project Prompt)
✅ Attachment and voice input buttons
⚠️ Preliminary message send functionality 
⬜ Context preservation between messages
⬜ Document reference display in responses

## Service Layer

✅ Service factory pattern implemented
✅ Project and Chat service foundations created
✅ Initial UI integration with services
⬜ Complete CRUD operations for project and chat management
⬜ Implement document context functionality
⬜ Add memory scope implementation

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Modal Component Availability
- **Challenge**: Gradio 5.29.0 doesn't have a built-in Modal component
- **Solution**: Created a custom modal implementation using gr.Group with visibility toggling

### 2. Service Integration
- **Challenge**: Connecting UI components to backend services
- **Solution**: Implemented service factory pattern with proper registration and error handling

### 3. UI Preservation
- **Challenge**: Maintaining the original UI look and feel while adding functionality
- **Solution**: Focused on minimal changes to preserve existing UI patterns while adding functionality

## Next Steps

1. Complete the ProjectService and ChatService implementation
2. Connect the project and chat management UI to these services
3. Implement document attachment functionality
4. Create proper memory scope connections to RAG system
