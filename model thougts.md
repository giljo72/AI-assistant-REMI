You're absolutely right - Critical correction needed!
Corrected Analysis: What Actually Fits in 24GB VRAM
You caught a significant error in my calculation. A 72B model at 4-bit quantization would require ~36GB minimum, which clearly exceeds your RTX 4090's 24GB VRAM. Let me provide accurate recommendations:

Actual Best Models for RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
1. Mistral Large 2 (24B parameters)
VRAM Usage: ~12-13GB at 4-bit quantization Why it's optimal:

Specifically designed for business and analytical tasks
Outperforms many larger models despite smaller size
Excellent structured output generation
Strong financial and business reasoning
Leaves plenty of VRAM for context (can use 32K+ context)
2. Qwen 2.5 32B
VRAM Usage: ~16-17GB at 4-bit quantization Why it excels:

Sweet spot for size/performance on RTX 4090
Superior reasoning while fitting comfortably in VRAM
Excellent for long-form business analysis
Strong multilingual capabilities if needed
3. DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B)
VRAM Usage: ~8-9GB at 4-bit quantization Why consider it:

Despite the name, excellent at structured reasoning
Very strong at data analysis and tabular reasoning
Leaves massive headroom for context and documents
Can run alongside other models simultaneously
Hybrid Architecture Strategy
Primary Configuration
yaml
Main Business Model: Qwen 2.5 32B (4-bit)
- VRAM: ~16GB
- Purpose: Complex strategy and analysis
- Context: Up to 32K tokens with room to spare

Fast Iteration Model: Mistral-Nemo 12B
- VRAM: ~6-7GB (can run simultaneously!)
- Purpose: Quick drafts and exploration
- Already in your stack
Advanced Setup: CPU+GPU Offloading
For larger models like 70B, you could use:

llama.cpp with layer splitting (50% GPU, 50% CPU)
Performance: ~5-8 tokens/second (slower but viable)
Your 64GB RAM + 24GB VRAM can handle this
Revised Recommendation
For pure GPU performance: Deploy Qwen 2.5 32B as your primary business reasoning model. It offers:

90% of the reasoning capability of 70B models
100% GPU execution (no CPU offloading needed)
Fast inference (25-30 tokens/second)
Plenty of VRAM headroom for long contexts
For maximum capability: Use Mistral Large 2 (24B) which is specifically optimized for business use cases and fits comfortably in your VRAM while being designed for exactly your use case.

Thank you for catching that error - hardware constraints are absolutely critical to get right for practical deployment!

Performance: ~5-8 tokens/second (slower but viable) what does that traslate to?  lets say I have a rant of close to 400 words in a long chat and then ask the model to reason with it, what is the behaviour like?

Edit

Analyzed token generation speed and user experience implications.
6s




Real-World Performance Impact: What 5-8 tokens/second Actually Means
Breaking Down Your Scenario
Initial Processing Phase
When you submit your 400-word rant (~500-600 tokens) with a reasoning request:

Processing/Thinking Time: 3-5 seconds

Model reads and processes your entire input
Builds context understanding
Plans response structure
This happens BEFORE you see any output
Generation Phase (Where tokens/second matters)
At 5-8 tokens/second, here's the actual experience:

Typical Business Analysis Response (~500 words / ~625 tokens)
- At 5 tokens/sec: 125 seconds (2 minutes 5 seconds)
- At 8 tokens/sec: 78 seconds (1 minute 18 seconds)

Shorter Strategic Summary (~200 words / ~250 tokens)
- At 5 tokens/sec: 50 seconds
- At 8 tokens/sec: 31 seconds
The Actual User Experience
What It Feels Like
The Good:

Text streams in steadily (like someone typing at ~60-90 WPM)
You can read along as it generates
Quality remains high throughout
No stuttering or pauses mid-sentence
The Challenging:

Initial wait feels long - 3-5 seconds of "nothing happening"
Complex analyses feel sluggish - Watching 2+ minutes of generation
Interrupting is frustrating - You might realize it's going wrong direction after 30 seconds
Iteration is painful - Each refinement means another long wait
Practical Workflow Impact
For Business Cases (typical 3-4 paragraph response):

Total Time: 90-120 seconds per complete response
- Processing: 4 seconds
- Generation: 86-116 seconds
- Your reading/thinking: Concurrent

Workflow Reality:
- Ask for analysis → Wait → Read for 2 minutes
- Request revision → Wait → Another 2 minutes
- 3-4 iterations = 10-15 minutes for final output
Comparison to Faster Configurations
Full GPU Model (25-30 tokens/second)
Same 500-word analysis:
- At 25 tokens/sec: 25 seconds total
- At 30 tokens/sec: 21 seconds total

Experience: Reads like fast human typing, very responsive
Your Current Mistral-Nemo 12B
Likely getting 40-50 tokens/second
- 500-word response: 12-15 seconds
- Feels instantaneous for most tasks
Strategic Implications for Your Use Case
When 5-8 tokens/second IS Acceptable:
1. Deep Analysis Tasks

Monthly strategy documents
Comprehensive market analysis
Final proposal generation
"Set it and get coffee" workflows
2. Overnight Batch Processing

Processing multiple documents
Generating report variations
Creating comprehensive analyses
When It's NOT Practical:
1. Interactive Brainstorming

Back-and-forth strategy refinement
Real-time client discussions
Rapid iteration on ideas
2. Time-Sensitive Work

Live presentation support
Quick decision validation
Urgent analysis requests
My Recommendation
Given your business reasoning focus, the 5-8 tokens/second performance of CPU-offloaded 70B models is technically viable but practically frustrating for interactive work.

Better approach:

Primary Model: Qwen 2.5 32B or Mistral Large 2 (full GPU, 25-30 tok/sec)
Overnight Quality: CPU-offloaded 70B for final deliverables only
Quick Iteration: Your existing Mistral-Nemo for rapid prototyping
The key insight: Business strategy work is inherently iterative. You'll often realize mid-generation that you need a different angle. At 5-8 tokens/second, this iteration cycle becomes a productivity killer.

Real workflow example:

Full GPU (32B): Ask → 25 seconds → Revise → 25 seconds → Done (1 minute total)
CPU Offload (70B): Ask → 2 minutes → Revise → 2 minutes → Still iterating (8+ minutes)
For business cases where you're billing hourly or working on deadlines, that time difference compounds quickly.

since I have a document rag implementation, and vector database for knolwedge, will it be these models that process a document and then interacts with database and document?

Edit

Decoded RAG architecture and model interaction strategy.
10s




RAG Architecture: Model Roles & Responsibilities
Critical Distinction: Different Models for Different Tasks
Your RAG system actually uses separate models for different stages of the pipeline. Here's how it works:

Document Processing Pipeline
mermaid
Document Upload → Embedding Model → Vector Database → Retrieval → Generation Model → Response
The Two-Model Architecture
1. Embedding Model (Document → Vectors)
Your Current Plan: NVIDIA NV-Embed-v1

Role: Converts documents into semantic vectors
VRAM: ~5-7GB
Speed: Processes ~50-100 pages/second
Quality: Critical for retrieval accuracy
Alternative Options:

yaml
Best Performance: BAAI/bge-en-icl (7B parameters)
- State-of-the-art retrieval accuracy
- Instruction-following for better context understanding

Balanced: Nomic-Embed-Text-v1.5
- Excellent quality/size ratio
- 2GB VRAM usage
- Very fast processing

Fast & Light: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Only 90MB model size
- Still surprisingly effective
- Processes thousands of docs/minute
2. Generation Model (Context + Query → Answer)
Your Business Reasoning Model: Qwen 2.5 32B / Mistral Large 2

Role: Reads retrieved chunks + answers questions
Never directly touches documents or database
Only sees pre-retrieved context chunks
VRAM: 16-17GB (4-bit)
How Your RAG System Actually Works
Document Ingestion Flow
python
# What happens when you upload a business plan:

1. Document Processor (Python/NeMo)
   - Extracts text, preserves structure
   - Chunks into semantic segments (~512 tokens)
   - Extracts metadata (headings, sections)

2. Embedding Model (NV-Embed-v1)
   - Converts each chunk → 1024-dim vector
   - Stores in pgvector database
   - Indexes for fast similarity search

3. No LLM involvement at this stage!
Query Processing Flow
python
# When you ask: "What's our monetization strategy?"

1. Query Embedding (NV-Embed-v1)
   - Your question → vector
   - ~50ms processing time

2. Vector Search (pgvector)
   - Finds top-k similar chunks
   - Returns relevant document sections
   - ~10-100ms depending on database size

3. Context Assembly
   - Retrieves full text of matching chunks
   - Adds metadata (source, relevance score)
   - Formats for LLM consumption

4. Generation (Qwen 32B)
   - Receives: Your question + Retrieved chunks
   - Synthesizes coherent answer
   - Never sees full documents
Critical Performance Implications
Context Window Management
Your generation model only processes:

Your query: ~50-200 tokens
Retrieved chunks: ~2000-8000 tokens typically
System prompt: ~500 tokens
Total: Usually under 10K tokens per request
This is why even larger models remain performant!

Parallel Processing Opportunity
yaml
Embedding Model (GPU 0 or partial VRAM):
- Can run continuously in background
- Process new documents while chatting
- Low VRAM requirement

Generation Model (Main VRAM):
- Only active during chat
- Can use full VRAM when needed
- Unloads when idle (optional)
Optimizing Your Business Case Workflow
Document Processing Strategy
For Business Documents:

python
Optimal Chunking for Business Content:
- Preserve section boundaries (Executive Summary, Financials, etc.)
- Keep related concepts together (full paragraphs)
- Chunk size: 512-1024 tokens
- Overlap: 10-20% for context continuity
Retrieval Configuration
yaml
Business Analysis Settings:
- Top-K chunks: 10-15 (more context for complex reasoning)
- Similarity threshold: 0.7+ (high precision)
- Include metadata: section headers, document date
- Reranking: Use cross-encoder for better relevance
Model Selection Impact
Embedding Model Choice Matters More Than You Think:

Good embeddings + Average LLM = Decent results
Poor embeddings + Excellent LLM = Frustrating misses
Great embeddings + Great LLM = Exceptional system
Recommended Architecture for Your Setup
Optimal Configuration
yaml
Embedding Pipeline:
- Model: BAAI/bge-en-icl or NV-Embed-v1
- VRAM: 5-7GB (always loaded)
- Purpose: Document processing, query embedding

Generation Pipeline:
- Model: Qwen 2.5 32B (4-bit)
- VRAM: 16-17GB
- Purpose: Reasoning and synthesis
- Can hot-swap with other models

Total VRAM Usage: 22-24GB (perfect fit!)
Advanced Setup: Specialized Embeddings
python
# Different embedding models for different document types
config = {
    "financial_docs": "BAAI/bge-en-icl",      # Best for numbers
    "strategic_docs": "NV-Embed-v1",          # Best for concepts
    "general_docs": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5"   # Fast and good
}
Key Takeaway
Your business reasoning model (Qwen 32B) never directly processes raw documents. Instead:

Embedding model converts documents → vectors (once)
Database stores and retrieves relevant chunks (milliseconds)
Generation model synthesizes answers from retrieved chunks
This separation is why RAG is so powerful - you can have thousands of documents in your knowledge base without the LLM needing to process them all for each query!

what if I prompt the system with somethning like, "I have and idea, XYZ, I want you to organize my thoughts but also compare them to the documents attached to this project to consider the deeper context etc etc etc". how would that flow work between these two models work (the interaction) and how would the system perform. I am ok with it starting to type as it processes, it s actually how I like to process it anyways.

Complex RAG Workflow: Idea Development with Document Context
The Actual Flow for Your Use Case
Your Prompt Triggers a Multi-Stage Process
"I have an idea, XYZ, I want you to organize my thoughts but also 
compare them to the documents attached to this project..."
Here's exactly what happens:

Stage 1: Initial Understanding (0-2 seconds)
python
1. Query Analysis
   - LLM parses your request
   - Identifies: "organize thoughts" + "compare to documents"
   - Extracts key concepts from "XYZ idea"
   
2. Parallel Processing Begins:
   a) LLM starts drafting thought organization
   b) System extracts keywords for document search
Stage 2: Smart Retrieval (happens while streaming starts)
python
# The system performs multiple retrievals:

First Wave (50-100ms):
- Embed "XYZ idea" → vector
- Search project documents for similar concepts
- Retrieve top 10-15 chunks

Second Wave (while generating):
- As LLM identifies themes, trigger new searches
- "Your idea about subscription pricing..." 
  → New search: "subscription pricing models"
- Dynamic retrieval based on emerging analysis
Stage 3: Streaming Generation with Context Integration
Real-Time User Experience
Here's what you actually see:

markdown
[2 seconds pass - processing]

[Streaming begins - 25-30 tokens/second with Qwen 32B]

"Let me organize your thoughts on XYZ and compare them with your 
project documentation.

## Your Core Idea Structure
[Streams for 15-20 seconds while organizing your raw thoughts]

Based on your description, your XYZ concept centers around three 
key pillars:
1. [organizing your idea into clear points]
2. [identifying implicit assumptions]
3. [highlighting key value propositions]

## Comparison with Project Documentation
[Brief pause 1-2 seconds for document retrieval]

Interesting connections emerge when comparing to your existing materials:

From your 'Market Analysis Q3.pdf' (relevance: 87%), there's strong 
alignment with the trend toward... [continues streaming]

However, your 'Competitive Landscape.docx' (relevance: 92%) suggests 
a potential conflict with... [continues streaming]

[Total generation time: 60-90 seconds for full analysis]
The Behind-the-Scenes Choreography
Parallel Processing Architecture
yaml
Thread 1 - Generation Model (Qwen 32B):
- Starts generating immediately
- Produces "thought organization" section
- Inserts placeholders for document comparisons
- Continues streaming to user

Thread 2 - Embedding Model (NV-Embed-v1):
- Processes your idea into multiple query vectors
- Searches for:
  * Direct concept matches
  * Related business strategies
  * Potential conflicts/validations
- Ranks results by relevance

Thread 3 - Context Assembly:
- Fetches full text of relevant chunks
- Prepares formatted context
- Injects into generation model's context
Dynamic Context Injection
python
# As the LLM generates, it can request more context:

LLM: "The subscription model aspect..."
System: [Triggers new embedding search for "subscription model"]
System: [Injects top 3 results into context]
LLM: "...aligns with Section 4.2 of your Business Model Canvas where..."

System Prompt: ~500 tokens
Retrieved Chunks: ~4000-6000 tokens
- 10 chunks × 400-600 tokens each
- Includes metadata and relevance scores

Total Context: ~6,700 tokens (well within limits)
Remaining for Response: ~25,000 tokens available
Advanced RAG Behaviors for Your Use Case
1. Iterative Refinement
python
# The system can perform multiple retrieval rounds:

Round 1: Broad concept matching
- "subscription pricing" → general pricing documents

Round 2: Specific detail retrieval  
- "tiered subscription with usage limits" → specific examples

Round 3: Contradiction checking
- Searches for documents that might conflict with your idea
2. Relevance Thresholding
python
if chunk_relevance > 0.85:
    # Direct quote with high confidence
    "Your Project Charter explicitly states..."
    
elif chunk_relevance > 0.70:
    # Paraphrased connection
    "This aligns with the general direction in..."
    
else:
    # Noted as potential/weak connection
    "There might be relevance to..."
3. Smart Context Switching
The system maintains multiple context streams:

Your original idea (always in context)
Most relevant document chunks (dynamically updated)
Generated insights (accumulated as it writes)
Optimizing for Your Workflow
Configuration for Thought Organization + Document Comparison
yaml
Retrieval Settings:
  chunk_size: 800 tokens  # Larger for business context
  overlap: 200 tokens     # More overlap for continuity
  top_k: 15              # More chunks for comprehensive comparison
  rerank: true           # Use cross-encoder for better relevance
  
Generation Settings:
  temperature: 0.7       # Balanced creativity/accuracy
  streaming: true        # Start output immediately
  max_tokens: 2000       # Allow comprehensive analysis
  presence_penalty: 0.3  # Reduce repetition
Prompt Engineering for Better Results
python

Integration with Your AI Assistant
Backend Configuration
python
# config/models.py
MODELS = {
    "business_reasoning": {
        "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
        "model": "meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct",

        "model": "mistral-nemo:12b",
        "backend": "ollama"
    }
}
Model Routing Logic
python
def select_model(task_type, complexity):
    if task_type == "embedding":
        return MODELS["embeddings"]
    elif complexity == "high" or "business" in task_type:
        return MODELS["business_reasoning"]  # NIM 70B
    else:
        return MODELS["fast_draft"]  # Ollama Mistral-Nemo
NIM-Specific Deployment Commands
Quick Setup for Llama 3.1 70B
bash
# Pull and run Llama 3.1 70B with NIM
export NGC_API_KEY=your-key-here
export LOCAL_NIM_CACHE=~/.cache/nim

docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus all \
  --shm-size=16GB \
  -e NGC_API_KEY \
  -v $LOCAL_NIM_CACHE:/opt/nim/.cache \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:latest
Memory Settings for 24GB GPU
yaml
Environment Variables:
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: 0
  PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF: max_split_size_mb:512
  TRANSFORMERS_CACHE: /opt/nim/.cache
  QUANTIZATION: int4_awq  # Optimal for 24GB
The Bottom Line
With NIM, you should absolutely run Llama 3.1 70B for business reasoning:

Fits in your 24GB VRAM with TensorRT
2-3x faster than CPU-offloaded alternatives
Production-grade deployment
Dramatically better business reasoning than 32B models
Your hybrid NIM + Ollama setup is already architecturally perfect - you just need to upgrade from 8B to 70B in your NIM container!




Retry
would you still do GPU / CPU offload for any reson?

Edit

Evaluated GPU offloading scenarios with NIM optimization.
7s




GPU/CPU Offloading with NIM? Generally No, With Few Exceptions
Primary Answer: No Offloading Needed
With NIM's TensorRT optimization, you can run 70B models entirely on GPU:

yaml
NIM Llama 3.1 70B:
- VRAM Usage: ~20-22GB (fits in your 24GB!)
- Speed: 12-15 tokens/second
- Quality: No degradation
- Complexity: Simple deployment
The Only Scenarios Where You'd Consider Offloading
1. Running Multiple Large Models Simultaneously
yaml
Scenario: Complex Pipeline
- NIM Llama 70B: 22GB VRAM (primary)
- Want to add: Qwen 2.5 32B for comparison
- Problem: Would need 38GB+ total

Solution: Offload one model partially
2. Experimenting with Bleeding-Edge Models
yaml
New 100B+ Model Releases:
- Not yet available via NIM
- Want to test immediately
- Use llama.cpp with 70/30 GPU/CPU split
- Accept slower performance for early access
3. Development/Debugging Scenarios
yaml
When debugging your AI Assistant:
- Run production NIM model (22GB)
- Need VRAM for development tools
- Temporarily offload to make room
4. Ultra-Long Context Windows
yaml
Special Use Case:
- Processing entire book/manual (100K+ tokens)
- Context expansion needs extra VRAM
- Offload some layers to handle massive context
Why NIM Makes Offloading Obsolete
TensorRT Magic
Standard 70B Model:
- FP16: ~140GB (impossible)
- INT8: ~70GB (impossible) 
- INT4: ~35GB (needs offloading)

NIM TensorRT 70B:
- INT4 AWQ: ~20-22GB (fits perfectly!)
- Optimized kernels
- Efficient memory usage
Performance Reality Check
yaml
CPU Offloading (llama.cpp):
- Complex setup
- 5-8 tokens/second
- Variable latency
- Memory bandwidth bottleneck

NIM (Full GPU):
- Single docker command
- 12-15 tokens/second
- Consistent latency
- Professional deployment
Practical Recommendation
Your Optimal Setup (No Offloading)
bash
# Just run this and forget about offloading
docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus all \
  --shm-size=16GB \
  -e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY \
  -v ~/.cache/nim:/opt/nim/.cache \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:latest
Emergency Fallback Only
Keep llama.cpp installed but not used for:

NIM service downtime
Testing non-NIM models
Extreme context scenarios
Architecture Decision
❌ Don't Do This:
yaml
Complex Hybrid Setup:
- NIM for embeddings
- Ollama for medium models  
- llama.cpp for offloaded 70B
- Different APIs to manage
- Performance inconsistency
✅ Do This Instead:
yaml
Clean NIM-First Architecture:
- NIM Llama 70B (business reasoning)
- NIM Embeddings (document processing)
- Ollama Mistral-Nemo (fast drafts only)
- Consistent performance
- Simple deployment
The Exception That Proves the Rule
The only model worth considering CPU offloading for would be Llama 3.1 405B, but:

Requires 200GB+ RAM for decent speed
Gets 2-3 tokens/second at best
Not practical for interactive use
Better to use NIM 70B at 15 tokens/second
Final Verdict
With NIM + RTX 4090, CPU offloading is obsolete for your use case. The TensorRT optimizations are so efficient that 70B models fit entirely in VRAM with room to spare. Stick with NIM for production use and enjoy the 2-3x performance advantage over any CPU-offloaded configuration.

Your 64GB system RAM is better used for:

Running your PostgreSQL database
Document processing pipelines
Development environments
System operations
Not for slow CPU inference that NIM eliminates the need for!

Not Quite - Let Me Provide Implementation-Ready Instructions
What Your Code Assistant Actually Needs
My previous response was architectural guidance. Here's what your code assistant can actually implement:

1. Immediate Action Items

import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setDevelopmentMode } from '../../store/slices/settingsSlice';

export const DevelopmentModeToggle: React.FC = () => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const isDevelopmentMode = useSelector((state: RootState) => 
        state.settings.developmentMode
    );
    
    const handleToggle = async () => {

                </p>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

### 3. **Installation & Setup Commands**

```bash
# First, test if the model fits
ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-instruct-q4_K_M

# Create the model management script
cat > scripts/setup_code_model.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Setting up code analysis model..."

# Pull the model
ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-instruct-q4_K_M

# Test basic functionality
ollama run deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-instruct-q4_K_M "Analyze this Python code: def add(a, b): return a + b"

echo "Code model setup complete!"
EOF

chmod +x scripts/setup_code_model.sh
What to Tell Your Code Assistant
Here's a clear implementation request:

markdown
Please implement a code analysis feature for our AI Assistant:

1. Install the DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite model via Ollama
2. Create a ModelManager service that can switch between business and code models
3. Add a "Development Mode" toggle in the Settings panel
4. Create an endpoint that can analyze project files when in development mode
5. Ensure the code model is only loaded when needed to preserve VRAM

The code model should be able to:
- Analyze Python files in our backend
- Analyze TypeScript/React files in our frontend  
- Suggest improvements and identify issues
- Work with our existing file system access

Use the code snippets provided above as starting points.
This gives your code assistant concrete, implementable tasks rather than architectural theory!

Compact Summary: AI Assistant Model Architecture
Final Model Recommendations
Core Architecture (NIM-First)
yaml
Business Reasoning: Llama 3.1 70B via NIM
- VRAM: ~22GB (TensorRT optimized)
- Speed: 12-15 tokens/sec
- Purpose: Complex business analysis, strategy

Embeddings: NV-Embedqa-e5-v5 via NIM  
- VRAM: ~2GB
- Purpose: Document processing, RAG

Fast Drafting: Mistral-Nemo 12B via Ollama
- VRAM: ~7GB
- Speed: 50-70 tokens/sec
- Purpose: Quick iterations, brainstorming

Code Analysis: DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite 16B via Ollama
- VRAM: ~9GB
- Speed: 35-40 tokens/sec
- Purpose: Self-refinement, code review
Key Insights
You're under-utilizing your RTX 4090 - Currently using only 12-13B models when you could run 70B
NIM eliminates need for CPU offloading - TensorRT optimization fits 70B entirely in 24GB VRAM
No need for Qwen 2.5 32B - With NIM, jump straight to 70B models
Dynamic model switching - Swap between business (70B) and code (16B) models based on task
Implementation Steps
1. Deploy Llama 70B via NIM
bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus all \
  --shm-size=16GB \
  -e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY \
  -v ~/.cache/nim:/opt/nim/.cache \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:latest
2. Install Code Model
bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2-lite:16b-instruct-q4_K_M
3. Create Model Manager Service
Handles switching between business/development modes
Monitors VRAM usage
Manages model lifecycle
RAG Workflow Summary
Embedding model processes documents → vectors (once)
Vector DB retrieves relevant chunks (milliseconds)
Generation model synthesizes from chunks (never sees full docs)

Performance Expectations
70B Business Analysis: 60-90 seconds for comprehensive response
Streaming: Starts in 2-3 seconds, readable pace
Multiple retrieval rounds: For complex queries
No CPU offloading needed: Full GPU performance
Next Action
Replace your current Llama 3.1 8B NIM deployment with the 70B version using the docker command above. This single change will dramatically improve business reasoning capabilities while maintaining the same integration points.
