# Immediate Next Steps

## 1. Create Backup (DO THIS FIRST!)
```bash
cd F:\assistant
python backup_to_e_with_timestamp.py
```
This will create: `E:\root\assistant_backup_20250527_HHMMSS`

## 2. Documentation Reorganization

### Step 1: Clean up Scope.md
- Remove all implementation details
- Focus on vision, intent, and goals
- Move technical details to Implementation.md

### Step 2: Update Implementation.md
- Add clear sections:
  - Current Implementation
  - Alternatives Considered
  - Future Enhancements
  - NIM Multimodal Roadmap
- Add progress tracking checkboxes

### Step 3: Create Project_Structure.md
- Document every folder's purpose
- List key files with descriptions
- Show module dependencies

### Step 4: Update README.md
- One paragraph summary
- Bullet point features
- Quick start only
- Links to other docs

## 3. NIM Multimodal Exploration

### Today's Tasks:
1. **Research NV-Ingest**
   - Read NVIDIA documentation
   - Understand architecture
   - Check Docker images

2. **Create Test Environment**
   ```bash
   mkdir F:\assistant\nim-exploration
   cd F:\assistant\nim-exploration
   
   # Create docker-compose for NV-Ingest
   # Create test PDFs with tables/charts
   # Write basic test script
   ```

3. **Initial Test**
   - Process one PDF with tables
   - Measure VRAM usage
   - Compare output with PyPDF2
   - Document findings

### This Week's Goals:
- Understand if NV-Ingest is viable
- Create proof of concept
- Make go/no-go decision
- Document integration plan

## 4. Code Cleanup

### Safe to Do Now:
- Delete all .bak files
- Delete frontend/src/components/chat/nul
- Move test scripts to /tests directory
- Archive one-time setup scripts

### Investigate First:
- Why multiple "cleaned" files exist
- Which LLM implementations are active
- If test_endpoints.py is needed

## 5. Critical Questions to Answer

1. **For NIM Multimodal:**
   - Can we fit it in 24GB VRAM with our models?
   - Is the complexity worth the benefit?
   - How much better is visual extraction?

2. **For Documentation:**
   - Should we version control old docs?
   - Where to put API documentation?
   - How to track feature deprecation?

3. **For Cleanup:**
   - Which test scripts are regression tests?
   - Can we consolidate NIM tests?
   - Should mock services stay?

## Order of Operations

1. **BACKUP FIRST** - Run backup script
2. **Document Current State** - Update Devlog with today's decisions
3. **Start NIM Research** - Begin with documentation review
4. **Clean Documentation** - One file at a time
5. **Code Cleanup** - After documentation is clear

## Success Criteria

By end of week, we should have:
- [ ] Clear documentation structure
- [ ] NIM multimodal go/no-go decision
- [ ] Cleaned up test scripts
- [ ] Working proof of concept (if proceeding)
- [ ] Updated implementation roadmap
